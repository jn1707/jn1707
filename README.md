👋 Hi! I'm a PhD student working on AI methods in the context of particle physics at the **Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen** Marie Skłodowska-Curie. My research is on data-driven approaches in particle physics to extract (un)conventional insights, uncover hidden patterns and fundamental physics 

## 🔬 A problem I’m grappling with:
Discovering astrophysical neutrino sources using transformer-based architectures

## 👀 I’ve got my eyes on:
Leveraging latent space representations to uncover hidden structures in particle physics datasets

## 🧠 I want to understand better:
Uncertainties in training datasets, especially MC simulations, and outputting credible confidence intervals
 

## 🛠️ My Projects
⚡ Contributing to the development of [DEIMOS](https://github.com/ts4051/deimos/tree/main) and [nuSQuIDS](https://github.com/ts4051/nuSQuIDS/tree/bsm) for the study of **Lorentz and CPT Violation:**
  - Implemented the Standard Model Extension (SME) framework to investigate the implications of potential violations of Lorentz and CPT invariance in neutrino physics.

🧊 Angular Reconstruction of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube collaboation

🤐 A project I cannot describe without spoiling it.
