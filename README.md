👋 Hi! I'm a physicist specializing in neutrino physics, currently conducting research at the **Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen**. My research focuses on the fundamental properties of neutrinos, their oscillations, and BSM physics.
## 🔬 About Me
I am passionate about uncovering the fundamental properties of the universe using neutrinos. 

## 🛠️ My Projects
- Contributing to the development of [DEIMOS](https://github.com/ts4051/deimos/tree/main) and [nuSQuIDS](https://github.com/ts4051/nuSQuIDS/tree/bsm) for the study of **Lorentz and CPT Violation:**
  - Implemented the Standard Model Extension (SME) framework to investigate the implications of potential violations of Lorentz and CPT invariance in neutrino physics.
